# Playgrounds
Playgrounds to check different ideas, also some POCs

Configured as a project to easily use CocoaPods in playgrounds.


### List of playgrounds
- __RuntimeWarnings__\
Trying to achieve runtime warnings in Xcode, working similar to `assertionFailure`, but without breaking app execution. Hacky, but working.

- __Rx+DisposeBag__\
Check, if its safe to use disposeBag inside struct

- __SwiftUI+Coordinator__\
Simple implementation of Coordinator (FlowController/Router) pattern in SwiftUI

- __Swinject+UnitTests_DependencyOverride__\
POC showing posibility to override dependencies for unit testing with [Swinject](https://github.com/Swinject/Swinject).
